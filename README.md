# DicePrototype - Documentation
### DicePrototype was created as a recruitment task to implement 12-sided dice physics-based rolling functionality, with the following requirements:
1. Every wall of a die has a number assigned that is visible to the player.
2. All numbers are easy to modify in the editor.
3. The die supports drag-and-drop with a mouse.
4. The project includes a simple UI showing the result of the previous throw, the sum of all throws, and a button to throw the die automatically.
5. The die never leaves the table, regardless of player actions.
6. Every throw ends with a result.
7. The project should be future-proof and easy to modify in the editor.

The assets were provided ahead of time, but the code and UI was created as part of the task.
